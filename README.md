# DSTI-Good-reads-project
Class project for the ML python labs

Introduction

The project has been realised using a jupyter notebook. To reproduce the results, you need to open the python files and go through the different modules.
You will need to install those following packages on your virtual environnement. To do so, you can use the requirement file.
